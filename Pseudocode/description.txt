Each rule is structured as follows:

A = Cat
B = Dog

Pattern one is: A {a} is not a {b}.
Pattern two is: A {b} is not a {a}.

List all possible rules based combinations in an grammar format.

Base the loop limit on the size of the rule list.

Find a match for the desired grammar pattern, and print that to screen.

If the grammar pattern doesnt match, go through grammar list until correct pattern found.
